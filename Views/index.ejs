            Hi, this is my multi functional and easy to use notes/to do app. It can be used to keep track of tasks you need to do, but 
            its functionality means you can also use it for notes! Do you have multiple projects with tasks or need to split up your notes?
            Don't worry because we have allowed you to make multiple cards and projects, all stored on a secure private database.

        <div class = "para">
            So how does the app work? Well to create a new project refer to the vertical navbar on the left and press the create a new project
            button, which generates a new project environment for you. You can insert a title or description for the project in case you come back
            to it later on and forget what it was for. To get started you can generate new card using the pen button at the bottom right of 
            the project screen. The cards have their own respective titles and descriptions which can be altered at any stage, and the tick button 
            changes it from an active task to finished and vice versa, but fret not because you can edit the contents of a finished card to make 
            any last minute changes. To delete a card press the bin button on the card, and the bin button next to the pen will delete the project, 
            so please be careful.

        <div class = "para"> 
            Originally, we had a lightweight app that used your device's local storage to store data. This is still available on 
            <a href="https://to-do-list-ogx116psw-m0ravats-projects.vercel.app/">here!</a>
